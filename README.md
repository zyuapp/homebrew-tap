# zyuapp Homebrew Tap

Install casks from this tap:

```bash
brew tap zyuapp/tap
brew install --cask just-speak
brew install --cask just-copy
```

Or install directly:

```bash
brew install --cask zyuapp/tap/just-speak
brew install --cask zyuapp/tap/just-copy
```

The previous `voice-to-text` cask remains available as a deprecated compatibility alias.
